# A* Path Finding Algorithm Visualization

This project demonstrates the A* pathfinding algorithm using Pygame for visualization. The algorithm finds the shortest path between a start and an end point on a grid, navigating through barriers.

## Project Structure

- `main.py`: The main script that uses the A* algorithm and Pygame for visualization.
- `algorithm/astar.py`: Contains the `Astar` class with a* pathfinding algorithm.
- `algorithm/node.py`: Contains the `Node` class representing grid nodes.
- `util/colors.py`: Contains the `Colors` class to encapsulate the different colors.

## Getting Started

1. Ensure you have Python and Pygame installed.
   ```bash
   pip install pygame

2. Run the main script
   ```bash
    python main.py
